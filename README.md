### Project Overview

For centuries coffeehouses have been a central meeting house for intellectuals and creatives to gather and discuss the politics of the day, controversial topics and conceive revolutionary ideas and projects. In 1864 Edmund Halley, Christopher Wren, and Robert Hooke met at their usual London coffee house to deliberate over the intracasies of celestial motion. From that meeting Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica, the basis of modern science, was born. French Englightenment figures Voltaire, Rousseau, and Diderot frequented Parisian coffee houses and arguably conceived of the Encyclopedie there. 

Coffee houses today no longer carry on this tradition. When you go to a coffee house now, everyone is preoccupied on their laptops, eyes buried in a book, or on their headphones. Wouldn't it be cool to recreate that amazing environment? 

But people don't do this anymore. When you go to a coffeehouse everyone is reading a book, on a laptop or has headphones in. Furthermore, it's very hard to meet new people with fresh ideas - if you approach someone on the street they think you're crazy. So here's the idea:

You want to meet people (maybe you're new to a city, have an entrepreneurial idea, want to discuss politics with new people) so you go to the website and sign up. You mark topics you're interested in, your zip code, etc. the site automatically matches you with 2 other people interested in a similar topics at a (top-rated, ie delicious) coffeehouse near you. Maybe at some point the coffee shops will offer coupons for users of the site? 

It could use foursquare API to recommend a coffeeshop you haven't been to before or that's on your to do list. 

After the meeting users "review" who they met: did they show up, were they obnoxious, etc. sufficient bad reviews and you're banned from the site.
